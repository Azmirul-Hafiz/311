<td>Volunteer Work/Community Involvement</td>
<td>Many companies are actively involved in their local communities, so any community involvement or volunteer work you reference could easily be considered relevant. If you've done any regular volunteering—with or without your relevant work skills—consider including the role(s) in a separate resume section.</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center"  bgcolor="#FF9B9B">
<td>Sports</td>
<td>A reference to the sports you play on a regular basis can be a great way to enhance some of the soft skills listed on your resume, such as being a team player, being able to work well with others, or having leadership abilities. Plus, maybe the employer has a sports team, or supports a local one, and would be interested in a sports-knowledgeable employee.</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center"  bgcolor="#FF9B9B">
<td>Traveling</td>
<td>Exhibiting a desire to experience new cultures and environments—especially if your role would involve working with foreign colleagues, partners or clients—can really help your resume shine.</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center"  bgcolor="#FF9B9B">
<td>Child Care</td>
<td>Whether it be babysitting for friends, taking care of your own kids, or working as a camp counselor, something like child care can be used to illustrate the fact that you're a responsible person who thinks of others (and who knows how to take care of others).</td>

<th>Why</th>
</tr>
<tr align="center"  bgcolor="#697BFF">
<td>Music</td>
<td>This can include everything from instruments you may play, to DJ-ing, to being an avid concertgoer, to simply being a passionate fan of a specific genre. You can get creative with categories like this. For instance, if you're in the process of learning to play the violin, use this as an example of your perseverance and willingness to learn new skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center" bgcolor="#697BFF">
<td>Pet Care</td>
<td>People love their pets, and pet owners definitely appreciate other pet owners. As with child care, this interest shows you as someone who can be counted on; it also shows off your warmth and compassion (two traits that are valuable to almost any employer).</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center" bgcolor="#697BFF">
<td>Gaming</td>
<td>Many companies, especially in the IT world, encourage multiplayer video gaming as a team-building activity and as a way to de-stress. If you're aiming for a job in tech, noting gaming as a personal interest could prove beneficial.</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center" bgcolor="#697BFF">
<td>Photographing</td>
<td>Research has shown that learning a new skill helps the brain and improves memory, and the more difficult the skill, the more improvement you get. Coupled with exercise, these two things are considered important for long-term brain health and neuroplasticity. Studies show that slower learning over time helps build strong new linkages within the brain.</td>
