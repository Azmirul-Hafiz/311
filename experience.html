<p>Co -curricular activities are activities outside the classroom that must be participated by all students. In fact, co -curricular activities are usually conducted after study time or on Saturdays. These activities include associations, clubs, games, uniformed units, and sports. I have been joining the scout team since another form to add knowledge and experience for bending the bamboo let alone from its shoots. While joining the school scout team, I had many experiences.</p>
<p>The school scout team is very active. We have to attend meetings every week. Usually, we will be trained to learn how to march on foot. This is said to be so because the uniformed unit foot parade competition is a major activity in the annual agenda of the scout team. By doing so, I learned the technique of marching by adhering to the principle of holding embers, let them turn to ashes. Although foot marching is a difficult exercise, I can still master it because I do not easily give up to learn something.</p>
<p>In addition, me and my friends who joined the scout team were also taught ways to set up a tent. This is said to be so because we had to set up our own tents without the help of the instructor during the camp. In this activity, we were taught the techniques of finding suitable stone, solid wood, and knowing the equipment that needs to be provided to set up a tent. In addition, we are also reminded to always remember the words of the parents that the same weight is carried, the same light is carried when setting up a tent with friends. By doing so, not only can a strong tent be erected, but an intact friendship relationship like stuff with nails can be built.</p>
<p>In addition, I also learned ways to provide emergency assistance. This is said so because the services of the school scout team are very much needed when the school holds programs such as Canteen Day, Sports Day, Meet the Customers Day and so on. Therefore, this knowledge of emergency assistance is a very useful knowledge to me. I was taught how to wash wounds, bandage wounds, and bandage broken hands when an injury occurred. I am very confident that knowledge in this field makes me stronger and resilient to face challenges as a student because of the knowledge of the lamp of life.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was also able to learn life skills when joining the school scout team. This is especially true because scout guidance teachers always share knowledge with us about trees that can be used as herbs to heal wounds and reduce pain. In the meantime, we were also taught to identify trees that store a lot of water to drink. With this knowledge I learned, the preparation to join a camp in the jungle will be more perfect. I always remember the message of the concerned teacher who said that where there is a will, there is a way.</p>
<p>Throughout joining this uniformed team, I also gained a lot of valuable life experience as a future supply. This is said so because I was able to learn the importance of working in a team because united we are strong, divorced we fall apart. For example, a camping activity can only be successful with the cooperation of all parties including accompanying teachers, trainees, and scout members. So I was taught to accept the fact that we have to live united to face challenges. In short, water is round because of sewers, human beings are round because of consensus.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the scout team was one of the co -curricular activities I participated in. I am convinced that each uniformed unit as well as the association and club has its own uniqueness. Students should participate to feel and go through the experience while participating in the activity. This is said so because if you don't know then you don't love. As a conclusion, we must respond to the call of the Minister of Education to make participation in co -curricular activities an important criterion in the acceptance of admission to universities or institutions of higher learning. Therefore, let us be active in co -curricular activities.</p>

<p>When you look back at the experience in school in the past, there are many. But the most memorable experience was the experience of being fined at school. There was a lot of experience of being fined in school before. But I will only share as much as I can remember. When I think back to the sense of humor, there is a reason it was my own life experience while studying at school. If the story is told to others, it may not be funny for them. Everyone has had the experience of being fined while in school before.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, time has passed so quickly. The school days have left me many wonderful memories that will never be forgotten. There are sweet memories and there are also bitter memories like the experience of being fined at school. Everything has been the most beautiful memory in this life. It’s about my own life.</p>
<p>Now I will begin to tell you briefly about the experience of being fined in school. The most I remember and come to my mind now is the experience of being fined when I was in primary school in grade 4. If I'm not mistaken, this event happened in 2008. At this time, the most popular game among my school friends is the game of marbles. The game of the villagers is popular these days. Nowadays, it's hard to find boys playing marbles.</p>
<p>Want to shorten the story, at the time of the subject of mathematics if I'm not mistaken. I remember the name of the teacher who taught me mathematics was Khairul. Cikgu is a bit funny too, but sometimes he can be serious too. During her class that day we were given our own work to do. Teachers are not in class, it's a pleasure because I can do activities that I like. What’s more me and another friend of mine took this opportunity to play marbles in the back of the class. Other people are busy doing school work but we also play marbles when there is no teacher. It's the best.</p>
<p>People say the sky is not always clear. In the middle of the fun, while playing marbles, I suddenly heard people shouting at us. Apparently the teacher has entered the class. What's more, he was angry with the teacher, he answered because he didn't work but played marbles. So, as a fine me and another friend I had to play marbles the whole time the teacher was out of class. My teacher said, I'm satisfied with the game. What's more, our fine started by playing marbles outside the classroom.</p>
<p>If no one sees us, we will be fined. It's fun not to be able to play marbles, but there are many other classmates who see us being fined by the teacher. The mood of having fun playing marbles was gone then. Play marbles in the middle of the heat when everyone else is studying in class. Shame on you for being fined at that time. There are other boys who do not want us to be fined, but I don't know. I have to endure the shame of being fined. After the incident that day, Serik did not play marbles in class for fear of being fined again. But the spirit and interest in playing marbles never faded at that time.</p>
<p>If you want to follow many more experiences, you will be fined at school first. For example, you have to stand on a chair, you have to stand outside the classroom, you have to pinch your stomach, you have to pull your ears and many more. The time of the boys was not free from mischief. The experience of being fined at this school became an experience that will be remembered forever. Maybe when I was fined, I felt angry. But when you think back it was a very valuable life experience. It teaches us many things. Every mistake has its retribution. If we do good we will not be fined.</p>
<p>The experience during my school days was wonderful. The experience of being fined, the experience of getting a gift, the experience of fighting with a friend and many other experiences. All of these experiences are part of our lives. It is about our own experiences while studying in school. Indeed, this school time is very fun to play with friends at school. But today they have all taken their respective paths. But the experiences and memories that are with them will be remembered forever.</p>

<p>For a bitter experience, in November 2007, I along with my mother and sister were involved in a car accident at mile 11 of Sandakan labuk road at 10.00 am. At that time, I was driving my white perodua kancil car and was on my way back to Kota Kinabalu after visiting the grave of my late father Ajak bin Dahari. In the accident, my car overturned several times on the road and the impact of the accident I who was driving on the driver's side was thrown to the left and crushed my mother who was sitting on the front passenger side while my sister who was sitting in the back collapsed under the bench .</p>
<p>Death was not on our side at the time and we all survived as a result of an accident caused by a Christian preacher driver who had slipped into the right lane while driving in a bend area. The result of the investigation by the traffic police found that the driver of the Toyota land Cruisher had been driving negligently and was fined a compound of RM300.00.</p>
<p>After dealing with the police and the car workshop, we continued our journey to Kota Kinabalu City in a state of trauma even though the day was getting late and we reached our destination at 12.00 midnight. Although we still remember the misfortune that befell at that time but we tried to calm each other and this was a bitter experience that will definitely be hard to forget. Indeed, death and matrimony are in the hands of the god who created human.</p>
<p>For a sweet experience, on November 6, 2008, my family and I held my uncle’s wedding ceremony in my village at Stage 6, Luboh Sungai Manila Sandakan Plan. Although the ceremony was made quite modest yet my feeling is to say that this is the sweetest experience I have ever had. My uncle and his wife's wedding ceremony was held at my mother's village house which was attended by my parents' relatives. my wife's side family was unable to attend the beautiful ceremony due to the distance and location of my village which took up to 8 hours to reach the destination.</p>
<p>However, the ceremony could be more lively because the people of my village were able to attend and witness the ceremony of my uncle and wife. Although my village lacks water supply, the guests who were present did not complain or complain about the lack of running water and were even happy to visit my uncle and wife's wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>Today is the 18th anniversary of my uncle's marriage to his wife but to this day I still remember and reminisce about that sweet event and feel that my uncle just got married yesterday. I am so happy.</p>

<p>During the last semester break, I went on holiday with my family in Melaka. We left at 3.00 pm. After a few hours, we arrived at our destination. We continued to the hotel that my father had booked. My family and I brought our belongings into the hotel. We then continued to clean up and relax.</p>
<p>At 8.00 am the next day, we prepared to visit interesting places in Melaka. We visited the Melaka Zoo located around Ayer Keroh. We could see all kinds of animals there.</p>
<p>After that, we visited the Melaka Museum, a famous museum in Malaysia. I can see the historical materials on display. I gained a lot of knowledge that could be used in writing and shared with friends at school.</p>
<p>After our family rested and had lunch, we continued our journey. We visited Bandar Hilir. There, there is the City of A’Famosa, the Stadhuys building, the River Cruise and many more. These interesting places have made me forget about the exhaustion of the whole day. Our family took pictures in interesting places as memories.</p>
<p>Finally, we bought handicrafts at a nearby store as souvenirs. I bought souvenirs for my teachers and friends. The beautiful and unique handicrafts will surely delight them after receiving the souvenir.</p>
<p>The next day, we packed our things to go home. Despite the fatigue, we remained happy and gained a lot of knowledge and interesting experiences.</p>
